# Ralph Loop

A tool/system for implementing RALPH-driven development - an agentic AI coding workflow.

## What is RALPH?

RALPH is a structured approach to AI-assisted development that breaks complex tasks into loops:

- **R**esearch - Understand the problem and codebase
- **A**nalyze - Break down the problem into steps
- **L**ist - Create a detailed plan/checklist  
- **P**roduce - Generate the code/solution
- **H**armonize - Review, test, and refine
